ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alex-k-9

Iâ€™m trying to learn to code

I can some do basic python thanks to Jose Portilla, Al Sweigart and others. 

I'm currently working through CS50... 

Otherwise I am working on my full time job, personal practise projects, codewars or project euler. 

As well as ðŸ’», I like â˜• ðŸ¦œ ðŸŽ¾ ðŸŽ¸ ðŸŽ¹ and some other things that can't be expressed with emojis
